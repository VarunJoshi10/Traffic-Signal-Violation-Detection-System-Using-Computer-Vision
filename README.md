# Traffic-Signal-Violation-Detection-System-Using-Computer-Vision
This Model captures the picture of vehicals which violates the rules and can be used for futher processing like vehicle number identification and getting the information about the Vehicle Owner.
This Model detects Violations like Red light running violation and Triple Seat Violation Detection.

## Technologies Used
- Roboflow
- OpenCV
- Yolov8
- CVZone

## Algorithms used
- Simple Online Real-time Tracking (SORT) Technique: SORT is a computer vision tracking algorithm for tracking objects while assigning an ID to each object.
- Real Time object detection using YOLOv8 on custom trained dataset.
